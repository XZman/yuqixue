I am a ECE Ph.D. candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am advised by 
[Prof. Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu/) as a member of the [Systems Platform Research Group](https://platformxlab.github.io/). My research focus is on architectures and systems for hardware accelerators. More specifically, I am interested in both efficiency and security of accelerators.

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from UIUC in 2021.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
